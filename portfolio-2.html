        <h4>5g-MOBIX Interview Series: 5g Talks With I***</h4>
        <p>I*** recently shared their experience working on the project, where they are a core member of the project’s technical management team and also lead the evaluation and dissemination tasks. The Athens-based E*** partner work alongside consortium members, xxx, xxx Turkey and Greece, xxx, xxx and xxx on the , developing the “See-what-I-see” CAM application which enables the exchange of live video stream between vehicles of a truck platoon. </p>
        <p>I*** Research Strategy and 5G-MOBIX alignment The 5G-MOBIX project was set up to assess the feasibility and value of supporting advanced CCAM applications in the challenging conditions shaped by a cross-border corridor environment where roaming presents significant challenges. Having a long and holistic research and innovation track record in the automotive / ITS domain, I*** believes the 5G-MOBIX objectives to be of vital importance for the future of the sector. Bringing together stakeholders from all over the globe with broader ecosystems, the project establishes a unique experimental environment offering an unprecedented opportunity for full-fledged experimentation. Leading the evaluation activities, I*** has the opportunity to shape the solution assessment space but also to fuel its research activities on multiple fronts, including both the CCAM application layer, with the I***-lead “See-what-I-see” use case, and others with delayed evaluations in the areas of networking and edge computing. Following up the investigation of hybrid 4G/5G-ITS-G5 technologies in the context of the project, 5G-MOBIX activities act as a natural next step in the research strategy of I***, providing a first in-depth look at the benefits and challenges of a holistic 5G approach for the CCAM domain. At the same time, it paves the way for subsequent activities in the context of and projects. </p>
        <h4>The Greek-Turkish Cross-border Corridor</h4>
        <p>The Greek-Turkish CBC presents the unique characteristic of corresponding to a so-called “hard-border” where authority checks enforce a stop-and-go mobility model, which presents a different set of mobility-related challenges. At the same time, it provides an environment for experimental evaluation of other types of applications related to the broader domain of 5G-enabled IoT and logistics e.g., in the form of customs inspection.</p>
        <p>After extensive fine-tuning and verification tests, the GR-TR corridor is ready to perform full-fledged trials in a series of interesting user stories including Track Platooning, See-What-I-See, Truck Routing among others. Trials will include various network configurations shedding light on technical aspects related to Home Routing / Local Break Out, inter-PLMN connectivity e.g., Leased Line vs. Internet-based and various handover schemes. </p>
        <p>The next steps and future plans The project is currently generating measurement data across all cross-border corridors and trial sites. In this context, I*** fine-tunes the evaluation activities across the project ensuring the completeness of the evaluation scenarios, the generation of preliminary feedback to the trialling activities, and of course the extraction of global conclusions and recommendations. At the same time, the I*** team leads the trailing activities of the See-What-I- See application.</p>
        <p>As a research institute, I*** is focused on the delivery of high-quality research results in the form of publications in prestigious conferences, journals, and magazines. This activity will include publications focusing on the I*** supported See-What-I-See application, as well as coordinated project-wide publications focusing on the major conclusions and corresponding recommendations emerging from the extensive trials performed. As such, I*** sets the ground for future large-scale pilots and trials in the automotive and related domains e.g., logistics, in the context of the evolution of 5G towards 6G, but also in the context of the extended deployment of 5G across Europe TEN-T corridors. </p>
        <p>The Greek-Turkish CBC public demonstrations are set to take place on 9-10 May 2022. Stay tuned for more details! </p>
        <p><i>The 5G-MOBIX project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 825496. </i></p>
